# NeuralNet
`NeuralNetLearning` is a neural network library that is great both for a beginner looking to get started quickly, and a technical expert wishing to implement their own features. It is built on the [`Vector<double>`](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/Matrix.html) and [`Matrix<double>`](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/Matrix.html) types in [Math.NET Numerics](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/).
